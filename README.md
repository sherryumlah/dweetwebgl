This repo contains a sample project utilizing webGL and dweet.io to allow a presenter to demo and manipulate 3D models for an audience.

To view a working demo, launch the demo controller in one window: http://www.sherryumlah.com/gap/controller.php
Launch the audience's view in another window: http://www.sherryumlah.com/gap

Via the controller, you can switch product models, zoom in/out, and spin the model and viewers will see the changes in the model.
