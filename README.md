This repo contains a sample project utilizing webGL and dweet.io to allow a presenter to demo and manipulate 3D models for an audience.
The app's controller interface can be used by the person manipulating the 3D model object, while others use the viewer interface to watch the interaction live from any web-accessible location.

Viewer Interface: Open the viewer in a browser window: http://www.sherryumlah.com/gap 

Controller Interface: Launch the demo controller in another browser window: http://www.sherryumlah.com/gap/controller.php  (best viewed with browser windows side-by-side) Via the controller, you can switch product models, zoom in/out, and spin the model and viewers will see the changes in the model.

Manipulating the object from the controller alters what appears in the viewer. Demo products during a webinar or walk around during a live presentation using your mobile phone as a remote control to manipulate what the audience sees projected.
